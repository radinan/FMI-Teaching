# Web Development with Java: Web Services

This repository contains educational materials exclusively created and lectured by me for the course "Web Development with Java" at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski". It focuses on Web Services, specifically RESTful services and the Spring framework, and is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical background and practical implementation of web services.

## Learning Outcomes

By engaging with these presentations, participants will:

- Understand the evolution of the web from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 and its implications on web services.
- Learn the fundamentals of HTTP, including request-response cycle, methods, status codes, and the importance of headers and bodies in HTTP communication.
- Gain a solid understanding of RESTful services, including their architectural style, advantages over SOAP, and practical use cases.
- Explore SOAP protocol's structure, standards, and how it differs from REST in terms of security, flexibility, and use cases.
- Dive into authentication mechanisms such as Basic Auth, Bearer Tokens (JWT), and understand the significance of encoding, encryption, and hashing for secure web services.
- Acquire practical skills in implementing web services using the Spring framework, including controller creation, request handling, and response formatting.
- Learn to apply validation in Spring applications and use MapStruct for efficient object mapping.

## Topics Covered

### Web Services (REST)

- Introduction to Web Services
- Evolution of the Web (Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0)
- HTTP Protocol Fundamentals
- REST vs. SOAP
- Authentication Mechanisms
- Practical Examples and Resources

### Web Services (Spring)

- Spring MVC Overview
- Creating Controllers in Spring
- Handling HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Implementing Validation
- Object Mapping with MapStruct
- Practical Coding Examples

## Dependencies and Resources

This course utilizes various dependencies to implement the concepts discussed. Below are the primary dependencies:

- Spring Boot (`spring-boot-starter-web`)
- Lombok for simplifying Java object construction
- Hibernate Validator for implementing validation constraints
- MapStruct for object mapping

For complete details on how to set up and use these dependencies, refer to the Maven links provided in the presentations.
